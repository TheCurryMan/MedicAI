Small urinary stones generally flow out on their own and can be “strained” out with the urine.  Larger stones, however, need to be broken up with medication, shattered with sound waves, or removed with a ureteroscope.   Removal is necessary, as kidney stones that clog up the ureter can cause urine to back up or they may cause an infection in the upper urinary tract (see the article on pyelonephritis), which can damage the kidneys."

    "Description": "A disturbed testicular descent, which is called cryptorchidism in medical terms, is a condition when one or both testicles are temporarily or permanently outside of the scrotum. The reason of it is usually that the descent of the testis/testes has not been completed and they cannot move into scrotum successfully at the latest within the first year of birth. This often happens with premature infant boys.",

The cause of a disturbed testicular descent is still not totally clear, hormonal disorders are very likely involved. It\u2019s well known that disturbed testicular descent happens more often to early-born than regular-born infants. However, there are other factors such as genetic problems, maternal health or environmental issues that can affect the hormone levels and the normal development of testicles. There are distinguishable types of cryptorchidism: 1) Retractile testis: it is located most of the time in the scrotum, but gets retracted in the inguinal canal due to an inordinate cremaster reflex. There is usually no treatment necessary. 2.) Gliding testis: it is located in the inguinal canal. It can be pulled in the scrotum by physical examination but then slides back. Hormonal therapy or surgery is necessary. 3.) Abdominal testis, inguinal testis, obstructed testis and ectopic testis: in those forms the testis is never located in the scrotum. Hormonal therapy or surgery is necessary. If a disturbed testicular descent is not found or cured earlier in time, the testicles may lose their function and lead to reduced fertility.
